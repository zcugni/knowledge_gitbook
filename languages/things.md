# Compiler, Linker, etc

## Assembler

* Transform assembly code into machine code \(aka binary\), creating object files

## Compiler

## Loader

* Loader is a part of operating system and is responsible for loading executable files into memory and execute them. It calculates the size of a program \(instructions and data\) and creates memory space for it. It initializes various registers to initiate execution.

## Interpreter

* An interpreter, like a compiler, translates high-level language into low-level machine language.
* Instead of reading the whole source code at once like a compiler, an interpreter reads one line at a time \(and execute it\)
  * It stops as soon as an error occurs and report it
