## GDB

* One elegant solution to this problem is to attach to the process after itâ€™s already running. In the output below, GDB is used to attach to an alreadyrunning tinyweb process that was started in another terminal. The source is recompiled using the -g option to include debugging symbols that GDB can apply to the running process. 
  * reader@hacking:~/booksrc $ ps aux \| grep tinyweb root 13019 0.0 0.0 1504 344 pts/0 S+ 20:25 0:00 ./tinyweb reader 13104 0.0 0.0 2880 748 pts/2 R+ 20:27 0:00 grep tinyweb reader@hacking:~/booksrc $ gcc -g tinyweb.c 
  * reader@hacking:~/booksrc $ sudo gdb -q --pid=13019 --symbols=./a.out

## Bash commands

```text
reader@hacking:~/booksrc $ $(perl -e 'print "uname";') 
Linux 
reader@hacking:~/booksrc $ una$(perl -e 'print "m";')e
Linux
```

* `seq` in bash
  * for i in $\(seq 1 3 10\)
* The nm command lists symbols in object files. This can be used to find addresses of various functions in a program
