# Stack layout in function

I'll detail what the stack looks like when we call and return a function, and how these three registers changes : `ip`,`sp`,`bp`

* Before calling a new function, this is the state
  * The stack filled with whatever was needed until now
  * **ip** points to the `call func` instruction
  * **sp** points to the **old** **sp** \(the content of whatever was needed previously\)
  * **bp** points to the **old** **bp** \(the content of whatever was needed previously\)
* When the function is called, these steps are taken :
  * Push the **arguments** to the stack
    * Push them in reverse order \(the last one first\), so the lowest address of the stack is the first argument
    * **sp** is changed
* The next steps are :
  * Push the address of the **next instruction** \(also called the _**return address**_\) on the stack, **sp** is changed 
  * Get the address of `func`, and set **ip** to it
  * Push **bp** to the stack \(so **old** **bp**\), **sp** is changed
  * Set **bp** to **sp** \(so the **return address**\)
  * Push **local variables** to the stack, **sp** is changed
* Just before the function returns, this is the state
  * The stack is filled by the **arguments**, the **return address** and the **old bp** address
  * **ip** Points to the `ret` call 
  * **sp** Points to the **old bp**
  * **bp** Points to the **return address**
* These are the steps taken to return the function :
  * Set **sp** to **bp** \(so the **return address**\)
  * Set **bp** by popping the **old bp** from the stack
  * Set **ip** by popping the **return address** from the stack
