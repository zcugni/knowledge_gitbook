# Terminology

## Interrupts

* Interrupts stop the flow of the program and give its control to another device \(when the device finished what it has to do, it'll give the control back\)
* The `0xCC` opcode is used for **breakpoints**. It's the **interrupt 3** and it's a trap to debugger, meaning that when it is raised, control is pass to the debugger

## Misc

* **Function prologue** : The few lines of code at the beginning of a function, which prepare the stack and registers
* **Function epilogue** : The few lines at the end of the function, which restores the stack and registers their original state
