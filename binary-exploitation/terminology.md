# Terminology

* Function prologue : The few lines of code at the beginning of a function, which prepare the stack and registers
* Function epilogue : The few lines at the end of the function, which restores the stack and registers their original state



## Interrupts

* Interrupts stop the flow of the program and give its control to another device \(when the device finished what it has to do, it'll give the control back\)
