# Hacking : The Art of Exploitation Notes

## GDB 

* Test if `set disassembly intel` works
  * Write it in the `~./.gdbinit` file
  * Test if you can define the hook-stop there too
* If the c source code was compiled with `gcc` with the  `-d` options, `gdb` can have access to the source code with `list`
  * i guess it's only the case when having acces to the source code, but you can examine a variable with `x/xw var`
    * And retrieve the address of a variable with `&var`
* Verify that the shorthand of the `info` commands actually work
*  `bt` Shows the stack backtrace
  * The backtrace also shows the nested function calls by looking at records kept on the stack. Each time a function is called, a record called a stack frame is put on the stack. Each line in the backtrace corresponds to a stack frame. Each stack frame also contains the local variables for that context. The local variables contained in each stack frame can be shown in GDB by adding the word full to the backtrace command.
