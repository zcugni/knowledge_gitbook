# Hacking : The Art of Exploitation Notes

## PLT & GOT

* Since a program could use a function in a shared library many times, it’s useful to have a table to reference all the functions. Another special section in compiled programs is used for this purpose—the procedure linkage table \(PLT\). This section consists of many jump instructions, each one corresponding to the address of a function. It works like a springboard—each time a shared function needs to be called, control will pass through the PLT.
  * the procedure linking table is shown to be read only.
  * they aren’t jumping to addresses but to pointers to addresses
  * These addresses exist in another section, called the global offset table \(GOT\), which is writable. These addresses can be directly obtained by displaying the dynamic relocation entries for the binary by using objdump.
  * . Another advantage of overwriting the GOT is that the GOT entries are fixed per binary, so a different system with the same binary will have the same GOT entry at the same add

## Bash commands

```text
reader@hacking:~/booksrc $ $(perl -e 'print "uname";') 
Linux 
reader@hacking:~/booksrc $ una$(perl -e 'print "m";')e
Linux
```

* `seq` in bash
  * for i in $\(seq 1 3 10\)
* The nm command lists symbols in object files. This can be used to find addresses of various functions in a program
