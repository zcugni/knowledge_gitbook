# Hacking : The Art of Exploitation Notes

*  Test if `set disassembly intel` works
  * Write it in the `~./.gdbinit` file
  * Test if you can define the hook-stop there too
* If the c source code was compiled with `gcc` with the  `-d` options, `gdb` can have access to the source code with `list`
  * i guess it's only the case when having acces to the source code, but you can examine a variable with `x/xw var`
    * And retrieve the address of a variable with `&var`
* Verify that the shorthand of the `info` commands actually work
*  `bt` Shows the stack backtrace
* 2 complements \(binary\) :  "First, the binary value 01001001 is shown to be positive 73. Then all the bits are flipped, and 1 is added to result in the twoâ€™s complement representation for negative 73, 10110111. When these two values are added together, the result of the original 8 bits is 0"
