## Introduction

* This are my notes for the binary exploitation exercises at [microcorruption.com](https://microcorruption.com/)
* A lot of stuff, like the available interrupts, are in the manual given by the website

## Architecture

* 16-bit architecture
* Little-endian
* Composed of 15 registers. 4 have special meanings :
  * R0 for `pc`
  * R1 for `sp`
  * R2 for `sr` \(Status Register\) - Flags used by conditional jumps
    * Z \(zero\) : It's set when it's value is 0003
    * N \(negative\)
    * C \(carry\)
  * R3 for `cg` \(Constant generation\)

## Value

* There's multiple way to specify or access a value :
  * \(Replace `y` by a number \)
  * `ry` The value stored in `ry` \(the name `sp` or `pc` can also be used\)
  * `@ry` The value in memory pointed by `ry`
  * `@ry+` The value in memory pointed by `ry`, also increment `ry`
  * `#y` The actual value `y`
  * `y` The value in memory stored at offset `r0+y`
  * `y(ry)` Add the offset `y` to the address of `ry`
  * `$` The current value of `pc` \(you can do `$+y`\)
* There's also suffix :
  * `.b` Byte operation
  * `.w` Word operation

## Instructions

* I won't detail all instructions, only the most useful to me
* Look at [this page](https://zcugni.gitbook.io/notes/binary-exploitation/assembly#instruction) for explanation of the common ones

### Single operand

* Some instructions are shortcuts for other longer combination \(which i call "actual instructions"\)
* Addresses can be function name when it makes sense

| Instruction | Actual instruction | Verbal Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `clr <address>` | `mov #0,<address>` |  |
| `tst <address>` | `cmp #0,<address>` |  |
| `push <address>` |  |  |
| `pop <address>` | `mov @sp+,<address>` |  |
| `call <address>` |  |  |
|  `ret` | `mov @sp+,pc` |  |
| `inc <address>` | `add #1,<address>` | Increment |
| `incd <address>` | `add #2,<address>` | Double Increment |
| `dec <address>` | `sub #1,<address>` | Decrement |
| `decd <address>` | `sub #2,<address>` | Double Decrement |
| `swpb` |  | Swap bytes \(for example, swap 007d to 7d00\) |
| `int <value>` |  | Trigger said interrupt |

### Double operand

* General syntax : `<intstruction_name> <source>,<destination>`
* Source  & destination can be values or addresses where it makes sense
* The basic set of instruction described [here](https://zcugni.gitbook.io/notes/binary-exploitation/assembly#instruction) is available
* Furthermore, these additional jumps are available :
  * `jlo` Lower
  * `jhs` Same or higher
  * `jn` Negative
  * `jge` Greater or equal
  * `jl` Less
