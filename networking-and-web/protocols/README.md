# Protocols

## Types of communication protocols

* **Connection-oriented** \(sometimes called "connected"\) : A connection needs to be established before communicating
* **Connectionless** : No need to establish a connection before communicating
* **Stateful** : At least one side keeps track of the state of the connection \(and generally act on it\)
