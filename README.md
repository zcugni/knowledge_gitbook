# Hello World !

Hi !

This is my personal **database of knowledge** i've accumulated in computer science. 

I've only started it a few years back, so there isn't everything, but it's probably around 70% of what i know. It's by far not complete, i kind of jumped from one subject to another until i found the specific field and technologies i wanted to focus on, so a lot of these notes aren't finished and might even contain false information. I keep them however because it will be a good base if i ever come back to those subjects. Check the disclaimer in the description of the page to know if it is a recent and up to standard one or not.

I put this online because it might be useful to somebody, we never know, and it doesn't really change anything for me.

I've haven't, however, re-written my notes for public viewing, so keep that in mind. Some of them are also entirely or in part in french, because it is my mother tongue and i tend to write in the language in which i found the information. I also apologies for any english error, i have a good understanding of it but definitely not a perfect one.

I now focus on pen testing, and i'm at the start of my journey in this field. I've started accumulating theoric knowledge of languages & technologies, as well as attacks and most common used tools. I know i could easily find again these information with a few google searches, but i find it more efficient to keep everything i once found useful in one place.

As my understanding of the field will grow, so will the content and structure of these notes evolved.

I hope it will be of use to you and wish you well !
